## Running scripts
- `yarn` to prepare your environment

### Development

- 'yarn run dev' to run and watch the unit tests

PS: once compiled, tests can also be run and debugged in visual studio code.

- `yarn run build-flex` to build it,
- then `yarn start` and go to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
